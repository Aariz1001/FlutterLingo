FlutterLingo is a Flutter-based User Management application enhanced with a language detection model.  It allows users to manage their profiles and experience content tailored to their detected language. This project showcases the integration of Flutter UI development with a remotely hosted machine learning model.

## Features

*   **User Management:** Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
*   **Language Detection:** Automatically detects the user's language using a hosted API.
*   **Personalized Content:**  Adapts the application's content based on the detected language (implementation may vary depending on the branch/version).
*   **Cross-Platform:**  Runs on Android and iOS devices (and potentially web and desktop with Flutter's capabilities).

## Installation

You can download and run FlutterLingo using either of the following methods:

**Method 1: Cloning the Repository (Recommended)**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aariz1001/FlutterLingo.git
    cd FlutterLingo
    ```

2.  **Get Flutter dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

**Method 2: Downloading as ZIP**

1.  Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page.
2.  Select "Download ZIP."
3.  Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.
4.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the extracted directory.
5.  **Get Flutter dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Prerequisites

Before running FlutterLingo, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Flutter SDK:** FlutterLingo is built using Flutter. You need to have the Flutter SDK installed and configured on your system. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

    *   Verify installation by running `flutter doctor` in your terminal. Address any reported issues.
*   **Android Studio or Xcode (Optional):**  While not strictly required, Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS) is recommended for building and deploying the application to emulators or physical devices.
*   **Python (for local testing, if applicable):** Although the language detection model is hosted remotely, familiarity with Python might be helpful if you intend to contribute or understand the backend API.

## Usage

1.  **Connect a device or emulator:** Ensure you have an Android emulator/device or iOS simulator/device connected to your computer.
2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    This command will build and run the FlutterLingo application on your connected device or emulator.

**Important Note:**

*   This application relies on a remotely hosted language detection API. Ensure you have internet connectivity for the language detection feature to work correctly.
*   The backend API is hosted on Render (or a similar platform).  Currently no details provided on the API's endpoint within the code. Inspect the code base for the API endpoint.
*   Confirm if you need an API key.

## API Integration

The language detection model is hosted as an API on Render. The Flutter application makes HTTP requests to this API to determine the user's language.  Check the source code (specifically, files related to language detection) for the exact API endpoint and request/response formats. The `flutter pub get` should resolve http packages.
